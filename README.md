AceProxy: Ace Stream HTTP Proxy
===============================
AceProxy allows you to watch [Ace Stream](http://acestream.org/) live streams or BitTorrent files over HTTP.
It's written in Python + gevent and should work on both Linux and Windows (Mac OS should work too, but was not tested)

Currently it supports Ace Stream Content-ID hashes (PIDs), .acestream files and usual torrent files.
